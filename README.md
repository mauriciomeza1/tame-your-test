# Tame Your Test 🚀

## What's This About? 🤔

Hey there! I'm Mauricio. Welcome to Tame Your Test. This is a part of a technical assessment, where I'm showing off some cool React and web dev skills. This little project is set up with Vite and React.

## Tech Ingredients 🛠

Here are some of the main tools used to cook this project:

- **React** (v18.2.0) - You know, for building user interfaces.
- **Vite** (v4.2.0) - A super-fast build tool.
- **CSS** - For making things look pretty.

## How to Get Started 🚀

### What You Need 📋

- You'll need Node.js and npm on your machine.

### Let's Do This 🎬

1. **Grab the code:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mauriciomeza1/TameYourTest.git
   ```

2. **Jump into the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd TameYourTest
   ```

3. **Install the packages:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the dev server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build the project (only if you need to):**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
